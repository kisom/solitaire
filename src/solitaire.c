 * In the book Cryptonomicon by Neil Stephenson, the solitaire algorithm is *
 * referred to as 'Pontifex'; for the purposes of disambiguation, the       *
 * implementation of the cipher in this software package is named Pontifex  *
 * and the front end is named Solitaire.                                    *
